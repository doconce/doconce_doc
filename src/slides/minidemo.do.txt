===== Starting point: basic math =====

!bblock Why Python?
Python is better than Matlab and C++ are for those with too much
spare time.
!eblock

Let's add!

!bt
\[ a + b = c \]
!et

!bc pypro
a = 2
b = 3
c = a + b
print c
!ec

!split
===== Moving on: breathtaking graphics =====

Let's plot!

!bt
\[ f(x) = e^{-x^2} \]
!et

!bc pypro
from numpy import linspace, exp
from matplotlib.pyplot import plot, show
x = linspace(-4, 4, 101)
y = exp(-x**2)
plot(x, y)
show()
!ec

## Include figure if not notebook

===== Lists are often used in slides =====

!bblock
 * Point 1
 * Point 2
  * Nested point
 * Point 3
!eblock

!bblock
 o Item 1
 o Item 2
  o Nested item
 o Item 3
!eblock

===== Slide elements can also be organized in MxN cells =====

!bslidecell 00 0.3
$e^{-x^2}$
