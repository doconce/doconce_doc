======= DocOnce: example on slide code with cells =======

One can introduce a table-like layout with MxN cells and
put slide elements in various cell. A cell with position
MN is surrounded by `!bslidecell MN` and `!eslidecell`
tags. Below is an example with a bullet list to the left and
a figure to the right (two cells, numbered 00 and 01).

======= Headline =======

|bslidecell 00
 * Key point 1
 * Key point 2
 * Key point 3 takes very much more text to explain because
   this point is really comprehensive, and although long
   bullet points are not recommended in general, we need
   it here for demonstration purposes

|bt
\[ -\nabla^2 u = f \quad\hbox{in }\Omega \]

!bpop
 * Mesh in time: $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$
 * Assume constant $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
 * $u^n$: numerical approx to the exact solution at $t_n$
!epop

!bpop
Numerical scheme:
!bt
 [
 u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
 \quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1
 ]
!et
!epop

!bpop
$\theta=0$: Forward Euler, $\theta=1$: Backward Euler,
$\theta=1/2$: Crank-Nicolson
