======== Experience with HTML5 slide environments ========

 * Firefox is the best browser
 * Chrome can show something (what?) that Firefox cannot
 * Use a wide view (full screen)
 * To many bullets on a slide makes deck (sandstone.default)
   reduce the font everwhere... Remedy: less bullet points!
