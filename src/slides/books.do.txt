===== How to write books for the past =====

One excellent and dominating tool: LaTeX

===== But the future books must address new devices =====

LaTeX PDF is suboptimal for screen viewing. Readers expect modern HTML style
and interactive pages.

===== I want to write *one book manuscript*  =====

No good ``LaTeX2HTML''...and it is probably impossible...

===== LaTeX is too rich =====

 * People tend to use a lot of packages with LaTeX
 * Only a subset of the constructs can be mapped to HTML
 * HTML platforms will need additional information
 * Translating a LaTeX book to an HTML platform is usually not feasible

!split
===== So what are the platforms for HTML publishing =====

 * HTML5 + CSS raw code
 * Sphinx
 * Markdown
 * IPython notebook
 * Wikibooks/MediaWiki

Good news: Sphinx, Markdown, IPython notebooks can generate LaTeX!

!split
===== Bad news: much manual work to create a traditional LaTeX book =====

 * Traditional books have a lot of cross referencing
 * LaTeX has floating elements, web pages have not
 * Markdown and IPython notebooks have very little support for cross referencing
 * Even with Sphinx, which supports cross referencing, a lot of manual work or hacks are required to produce a thesis or a book
 * What about an index?
 * What about boxes (admonitions)?

Sphinx has admonitions and index, but not Markdown...

!split
===== Adopt a new writing style! =====

 * The classical science book writer will miss a lot in Sphinx, Markdown, IPython notebooks and needs to adopt a new writing style
 * It remains to see if such a style is successful as a (classial) book


!split
===== And there is an explosion of new platforms for digital learning systems! =====

Different platforms have different input format (or just interactive input):
"MOOCs": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW3gMGqcZQc#t=127",
"Kahn Academy": "https://www.khanacademy.org/",
"ndla": "http://ndla.no/",
"H5P": "http://h5p.org",
"Haiku Learning": "http://www.haikulearning.com/",
"Opigno": "https://www.opigno.org/en", ...

*LaTeX-for-paper* and *HTML-for-screen* are two very different
writing styles and technology platforms.

======= Some experience from Univ. of Oslo =======

!split
===== Going from LaTeX to IPython notebooks =====

 * Several professors have LaTeX books and want to make them interactive
 * Not feasible to do a direct (manual) translation, because a major
   rewrite and change of style is necessary
 * Slides and simple study guides (with hardly no cross referencing)
   have been successfully translated
   directly to IPython notebooks via scripts

!split
===== An experimental one-size-fits-all solution =====

"DocOnce": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce"
is a kind of extended Markdown that can produce

   * classical LaTeX books
   * Sphinx
   * raw HTML
   * Markdown
   * IPython notebooks
   * MediaWiki
   * ...and much more

!split
===== DocOnce is basically a multi-stage preprocessor =====

 * Start: Markdown-style moderately tagged ascii text
 * Stages:
   o Preprocess (C-like preprocessor)
   o Mako (rich Python-like template language)
   o Translation to LaTeX, Sphinx, Markdown, IPython notebook, ...

===== DocOnce is just an example, not a universal solution =====

 * The universal solution should be an object model (like DocBook)
 * There must be strong support for math and all sorts of
   computer code (snippets, programs, hidden code, interactive, shells, ...)
 * Users must be able to plug in new objects with renders
 * There must be some minimally tagged input
