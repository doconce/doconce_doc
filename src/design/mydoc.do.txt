======= Solve the world's simplest differential equation =======

===== Mathematical problem =====

This exercise addresses the differential equation problem

!bt
\begin{align}
u'(t) &= -au(t), \quad t \in (0,T], label{ode}\\
u(0)  &= I,                         label{initial:value}
\end{align}
!et
where $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed constant parameters, and $u(t)$ is
the unknown function to be estimated. This mathematical model
is relevant for physical phenomena featuring exponential decay
in time.

===== Numerical solution method =====

Derive the $\theta$-rule scheme for solving (ref{ode}) numerically
with time step $\Delta t$:

!bt
\[
u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
\]
!et
Here, $n=0,1,\ldots,N-1$.

!bhint
Set up the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson (or
Midpoint) schemes first. Then generalize to the $\theta$-rule above.

===== Implementation =====

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function
`solver` (found in the "`decay_mod`":
"https://github.com/doconce/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" module):

!bc pycod
from numpy import linspace, zeros

def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
!ec


===== Numerical experiments =====

Fix the values of where $I$, $a$, and $T$.
Then vary $\Delta t$ for $\theta=0,1/2,1$.
Illustrate that if $\Delta t$ is not sufficiently small,
$\theta=0$ and $\theta=1/2$ can give non-physical solutions
(more precisely, oscillating solutions).

Perform experiments and determine empirically the convergence
rate for $\theta=0,1/2,1$.
