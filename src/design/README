The main document in this directory is wrapper_tech.do.txt.
View it by loading wrapper_tech.html into a browser.

The make.sh script generates all the files that are referred to
in the wrapper_tech document. The sample document that wrapper_tech
applies as example is mydoc.do.txt. Many variants are available
as mydoc*.html - these can be examined in a browser.

(wrapper_tech.do.txt refers to a lot of local HTML files, which is
fine as long as all files in this directory are located together,
but for sphinx output, one should take a copy of every local file
that is linked to in wrapper_tech.do.txt and place in a _static
directory.)
