## Mako in a nutshell:
## <% ... %> contains arbitrary Python code.
## ${name(...)}$ calls a Python function name with the given arguments.
## In this way, we can define Python code that is run when Mako is run
## and insert values of variables or function calls around in the text
## with the ${...}$ syntax.

# #ifdef INTERNAL
## Here the Python code is embedded directly in Mako <% %> tags.
## This is not recommended because debugging is quickly a nightmare.
<%
import sympy as sm
x, y, a = sm.symbols('x y a')
f = a*x + sm.sin(y)
step1 = sm.Integral(f, x, y)
step2 = sm.Integral(sm.Integralf, x).doit(), y)
step3 = step2.doit()
%>
# #else
## Here Python code is copied from a file. This is recommended
## since the file can be debugged the normal way.
<%
# #include "src/ex1.py"
%>
# #endif

## Note how we use variables from SymPy directly
## in the text (here equations) with the ${sm.latex(var)}$
## syntax.

!bt
\begin{align*}
${sm.latex(step1)} &= ${sm.latex(step2)}\\
&= ${sm.latex(step3)}
\end{align*}
!et

## Let's solve a quadratic equation
<%
import sympy as sm
x, y, a = sm.symbols('x y a')
b, c = sm.symbols('b c')
eq = a*x**2 + b*x + c
s = sm.solve(eq, x)
%>

The solution of $${sm.latex(sm.Eq(eq))}$ is

!bt
\[ x = ${sm.latex(s)} \]
