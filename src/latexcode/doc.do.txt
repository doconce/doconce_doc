======= Data file =======

Suppose we have some data in a file. The final
result of including this file with `@@@CODE mydat.txt` (which implies
a code environment starting with `!bc dat`) looks like this:

@@@CODE mydat.txt envir=dat

======= Complete program and terminal output =======

The following program
# #if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex')
(which breaks a page)
# #endif
reads the data in the file and performs analysis (typeset with `!bc pypro`):

@@@CODE fileread.py
The output becomes (typeset with `!bc sys`):

!bc sys
Terminal> python fileread.py

======= Code snippet =======

Fortran 77 is also sometimes handy. Snippets in that language are
typeset inside `!bc fcod` environments.

!bnotice Fortran code box
!bt
\[ r_i = ca_i,\quad i=1,\ldots,n\]
!et

!bc fcod
       subroutine process(a, n, c, r)
C      This subroutine returns array r = c*a
       integer n
       real*8 a(n), c, r(n)
       integer i
       do i = 1,n
          r(i) = c*a(i)
       end do
       return
       end
