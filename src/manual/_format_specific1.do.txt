First some math:

|bt
\begin{align}
x &= 3
label{x:eq1}\\
y &= 5
label{y:eq1}
\end{align}
|et
Let us now reason about this.

# Sphinx cannot refer to labels in align environments

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html")
From (\ref{x:eq})-(\ref{y:eq1}) we get that
# #elif FORMAT == "sphinx"
From
|bt
\[ x = 3 \]
|et
and
|bt
\[ y= 5 \]
|et
it follows that
# #else
From the above equations it follows that
# #endif
$x+y$ is 8.
