__Summary.__
Quick demo of how to make figures with TikZ in DocOnce.

======= Ideas =======

"TikZ": "http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~hellmund/LaTeX/pgf-tut.pdf"
is a useful tool for making figures in LaTeX, and DocOnce supports
these figures. If a figure file `myfig` exists in a version
`myfig.tikz`, DocOnce will, for `latex` or `pdflatex` output,
use the `myfig.tikz` figure directly. The problem is what do to
with other output formats? In `html` format one can use a
corresponding SVG version of the figure; for other formats, one
needs a plain PNG file.  DocOnce will automatically create these figure
versions and store them with the `myfig.tikz` figure, as is
done when other figure formats are automatically generated.

======= A modest beginning =======

FIGURE: [line, width=500] This shape is commonly referred to as a *straight line*. label{line}

The most fundamental shape is the line in Figure ref{line}. See the
"source code":
"https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/line.tikz"
for how this TikZ figure is defined in LaTeX as a file `line.tikz`
(and included in DocOnce through `FIGURE: [line, width=500] caption`).  Such
lines can be combined to form other shapes, e.g., a square. However, Figure ref{square}
was created using the "`rectangle`":
"https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/square.tikz"
TikZ command.

FIGURE: [square, width=300] This square is formed by four straight lines. label{square}

A "grid":
"https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/grid.tikz"
can also be easily made.

FIGURE: [grid, width=300] This is a grid with 5 x 5 cells

A circle, however, cannot be formed by a finite number of straight lines.
It requires "special code":
"https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/circle.tikz".

FIGURE: [circle] This circle is drawn in blue with a dashed line.


======= More advanced figures =======

FIGURE: [maze, width=400] A "maze": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/maze.tikz" can be drawn by combining rectangle elements.

FIGURE: [graph] TikZ is well suited to draw "graphs": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/graph.tikz".


======= Plotting functions =======

TikZ can be used to plot functions. The next figure will be inlined.

FIGURE: [plot1, width=600]

See the "source code": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/plot1.tikz" for how you make this figure.

FIGURE: [plot2, width=500] The functions can even be labeled!

All details are in the "source code": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/plot2.tikz".
