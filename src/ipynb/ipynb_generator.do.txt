__Summary.__ This note explains how to write your own notebook
generator in Python such that you can write a notebook in
plain ascii in your favorite editor. Futhermore, we add
functionality in this new notebook format such that you can
introduce variables and other
programming constructs into the text as well as run computations
in the background while generating the notebook.

Ascii input is particularly useful if you have LaTeX code
that you want to make use of in notebooks. Then you must
translate the LaTeX code to the syntax described here and
run the "compiler": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/ipynb/ipynb_generator.py" to be described.

======= Sample problem =======

The notebook generator will be demonstrated through a specific example.
on writing a little report where we 1) present a differential
equation, 2) solve it by SymPy, and 3) show Python code for the solution and
some computations. We show how the SymPy calculations can be
done on the fly while compiling the document: results in Python variables
from the SymPy calculations
are magically propagated into the text. (This functionality is quite
similar to "PythonTeX": "https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex", but
just based on a standard template language, Mako, instead of quite
comprehensive LaTeX code.)

======= The ascii notebook format =======

===== Cell delimiter lines =====

We go for a very simple format: `-----` is delimiter lines between cells.
Cells are written in either plain Markdown or as a set of statements in
a programming language, depending on whether the cell is a text or
code cell.

Deliminter lines with an extension text `x`, as in `-----x`,
indicates code cell in language `x`, where `x` is a short name for
the language, typically the file extension: `py` for Python,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `js` for JavaScript,
`sh` for Bash or another Unix shell, `sys` for the console (terminal
window),
`java` for Java, `tex` for LaTeX or TeX, `html` for HTML, etc.

If `x` is proceeded by `-t` it means that the cell is *not a code cell*,
but a standard static Markdown code cell typeset within triple backticks
as usual in Markdown. (Sometimes one wants to show code, but it is not
intended to be executable.)

===== Include lines =====

It is handy to include other files in a document so we invent the
syntax `#include "filename"` at the beginning of a line to include a file
with name `filename`.

!bnotice Tip: the include syntax can be extended.
Since we are in charge of parsing the ascii input file, we can
invent more sophisticated syntax for including files. For example,
we may specify a start and an end line, either by numbers or
preferably by regular expressions (which tend to be more robust in that
they changes less often than line numbers).
The syntax could be like

!bc
#include "myprog.py" fromto: from_regex@to_regex
!ec
However, this extension is not incorporated in the first version of
the notebook generator. We just mention the possibility.

===== Mako processing =====

It is also very handy to run the text through a preprocessor that is
a full-fledged template programming language of the type that is
popular in the web world. Here we have chosen
"Mako": "http://www.makotemplates.org". Running the text through Mako
enables the use of variables, if-tests, and loops, to menition the
most usual constructs. Pure Python functions can be defined inside
`<%` and `%>` and called
in the code. Mako applies the syntax `${var}` for variables and
`${myfunc(arg1, arg2=None)}` for function calls.

!bnotice Tip: put Python code in a separate file for testing!
Having lots of Python code inside `<%` and `%>` Mako tags is not
recommended as debugging can be a nightmare. Instead, put the code
in a file, say `myprog.py`, and just include it:

!bc
<%
#include "myprog.py"
%>
!ec
Then you can debug `myprog.py` as standard Python code, but call up
its functions and use its global variables in the document's text (!).

===== Example on syntax =====

Let us show a very simple document with some code, some math, and
use of include and Mako. The task is to solve a differential equation
by SymPy on the fly in the code and use SymPy output directly
in the text. For this goal, we write the SymPy code in a separate
file where a `dump` function can be used for heavily printing
of intermediate results, but a global variable `allow_printing`
determines whether printing is turned on and off: we want it on
when debugging, but off when compiling our document.

The document starts with an author, his address, and the date, where
author and address are Mako variables we can specify on the command line
when compiling the document. This text is a Markdown cell and therefore
starts with `-----`:

@@@CODE .test1.aipynb fromto: -----@## Math
Note that a double `##` is a Mako comment line and it will not be a
part of the final output from Mako. `IC` is another variable that must
be specified on the command line (and fed to Mako) for the initial
condition of the differential equation.

Next follows the math part where we have an included SymPy code
to solve the math problem. The SymPy is in the file `.solve_dyeqy.py`:

@@@CODE .solve_dyeqy.py
This is just standard Python code. The `__name__` variable equals
`__builtin__` when we run this code inside Mako so then the test block
is inactive. Instead, we can define `allow_printing = False`,
call `solve()`, and store its output in variables such that we can access
them in the running text. Here is the syntax:

@@@CODE .test1.aipynb fromto: # Math@## Code
Note how we in the middle of math expressions use Mako variables taken
from both the command line, such as `${IC}`, and from the
Python code, such as `${y_expr}` and `${C_expr}`!

We can now define some code cells for execution. We want to
create a Python code for the solution, using the SymPy variable
`y_expr` and SymPy's ability to write the expression for
a numerical Python function, here called `y(t)`. Note that the
delimiter for a Python code cell is `-----py`.

@@@CODE .test1.aipynb fromto: ## Code@## Compilation

!bwarning Remark
The way we use Mako here hides the computations by SymPy.
Sometimes this is the desired behavior in a text. In other
occasions, however, you may want to show all the SymPy steps
and then you can do that explicitly in notebook cells.
If you want to show just some selected steps, you can
show the code as Markdown code using the delimiter `-----py-t`
instead of `-----py`.
!ewarning

Finally, we show how to compile the ascii file into a Jupyter Notebook,
using a console cell that is to be shown as plain Markdown Bash code.

@@@CODE .test1.aipynb fromto: ## Compilation@

What we have not shown here, is the ability to call Python functions
in the text. We could, if it was sensible, call the `solve` function
in the text, e.g., as in
`...and the solution becomes ${solve()[0]}`. In addition, you can
define lists and dictionaries in Python and walk through them in
the text with the Mako constructs `% for e in mylist:` and
`% for key in mydict:`. Indentation does not count, so the for loop
must be ended with `% endfor`. Similarly, there is branching using
the syntax `% if condition:`, `% elif condition:`, `% else:`, and
finally `% endif`.

======= The compiled file =======

We compile "our example file": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/ipynb/.test1.aipynb" by the following command:

!bc sys
Terminal> python ipynb_generator.py .test1.aipynb NAME="Core Dump" \
          ADDRESS="ADDRESS=Seg. Fault Ltd and Univ. of C. Space" \
	  IC=2
!ec
Note that some Mako variables are supposed to be given on the command line,
here three, while others are defined in Python code within `<%` and `%>`
tags in the document.

The output of the `ipynb_generator.py` command above
is a notebook file `.test1.ipynb`. The file looks like this:

@@@CODE .test1.ipynb

The notebook file resides in GitHub and can be automatically
"rendered there": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/ipynb/.test1.ipynb".

======= The generator code =======

We shall now list the code that translates the ascii input, with the
special syntax explained, into a notebook. The algorithmic steps are

 o Read the file.
 o Find all include lines and include the corresponding text.
 o Run Mako on the file.
 o Make a `cells` list of all cells., i.e., detect
   the beginning of a new cell by the delimiter line `-----`.
   The `cells` list consists of elements of 3-lists, where each
   3-list has the cell type, a description, and all the lines of
   the cell as its three elements.
 o When making a new element in `cells`, see if the delimiter
   line has a language specification and therefore is a code cell,
   or if it is a plain Markdown code cell.
 o Go through `cells` and join separate lines in each cell into a string.
 o Import functions from `IPython.nbformat.v4` for translating
   the information in the `cells` list into a cell list `nb_cells` suitable
   for the nootebook.
 o Write the `nb_cells` list to JSON format.

The `read` function looks as follows.

@@@CODE ipynb_generator_v4.py fromto: def read@def write
The line `fullname = shortname2language[shortname]` is not easy
to understand unless we have the definition of the dictionary

@@@CODE ipynb_generator_v4.py fromto: # Mapping of @def read

The translation from a `cells` list to the similar list needed
by the IPython notebook writing functions is taken care of
in the following function:

@@@CODE ipynb_generator_v4.py fromto: def write@def driver

A driver or main program is needed:

@@@CODE ipynb_generator_v4.py fromto: def driver@def test_

The "true generator file": "https://github.com/doconce/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/ipynb/ipynb_generator.py" has support for notebook format version 3 and 4
and contains also a lot of `logging` statements to aid
debugging.

!bsummary
Hopefully, this example has shown

 o how to generate your input own format for writing Jupyter notebooks,
 o how you can extend such a format with a preprocessor like Mako,
 o how the `IPython.nbformat` functions can be used for writing notebooks.
