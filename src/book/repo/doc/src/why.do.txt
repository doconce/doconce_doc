========= Why DocOnce? =========
label{ch:why}

Scientific books are very often written in LaTeX, but LaTeX is primarily
suited for PDF output on paper. Today, your readers will be using different
devices like tablet and phones for reading, and to address these media
you need to write HTML. DocOnce lets you write in a syntax that is as
simple as you use in email, and can then automatically translate that
syntax to highly professional LaTeX or HTML for output (it can produce
other formats too). So, the writing itself is easier since you avoid a lot
of LaTeX or HTML tags, and the output is more versatile. We refer to the
DocOnce tutorial and the web page for more arguments!
