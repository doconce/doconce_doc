This note tells why and how you can use DocOnce to ease the writing of
scientific books with much mathematics and computer code.

.. All books have a table of contents

.. _ch:why:

Why DocOnce?
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Scientific books are very often written in LaTeX, but LaTeX is primarily
suited for PDF output on paper. Today, your readers will be using different
devices like tablet and phones for reading, and to address these media
you need to write HTML. DocOnce lets you write in a syntax that is as
simple as you use in email, and can then automatically translate that
syntax to highly professional LaTeX or HTML for output (it can produce
other formats too). So, the writing itself is easier since you avoid a lot
of LaTeX or HTML tags, and the output is more versatile. We refer to the
DocOnce tutorial and the web page for more arguments!

Hwo do I get started?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

.. index:: getting started

.. index:: book project setup

1. Read the web page: `<https://github.com/hplgit/doconce>`_

2. Read the tutorial to get a glimpse of the basic syntax

 a. `HTML format <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tutorial/tutorial.html>`__

 b. `PDF for printing <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tutorial/tutorial.pdf>`__

3. Familiarize yourself with the `manual <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.html>`__

4. Install DocOnce and all it needs: try to run
   the entire `Bash script <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/raw/master/doc/src/manual/install_doconce.sh>`__ (just comment out lines that don't work and rerun)

5. Make a GitHhub or Bitbucket Git repository for the book project,
   see `quick intro <http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/bitgit/Langtangen_bitgit-bootstrap.html>`__ (or `PDF for printing <http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/bitgit/Langtangen_bitgit_4print.pdf>`__)

6. Take a brief look at the `best practice document <http://hplgit.github.com/setup4book-doconce/doc/web/index.html>`__ which documents the setup of files

7. Download the `tarfile <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/raw/master/doc/src/book/root/doconce_demo_book.tar>`__ with a dummy file tree to be packed out in the root directory of the book repo (remember commit and push!)

8. Go to ``doc/src`` and **start writing the first chapter!** (replace ``why.do.txt``)

9. **Compile the document to PDF**: ``bash make.sh``, see ``my-book-4print.pdf``
   (this is the standard Springer book layout, the ``svmono`` class adapted to
   DocOnce)

10. **Compile the document to HTML**: ``bash make_html.sh``, see ``my-book.html``

Some real writing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

.. index:: syntax example

Let us demonstrate *emphasize text*, **bold text**, ``inline monospace font``,
and of course computer code that we can copy from a part of a file
using regular expressions:

.. code-block:: python

    def f(x):
        return 42*x

.. Above we copy from def f up to, but not including,

.. the def g line in mmycode.py

It is a big advantage to copy computer code directly into the book, but
you can also write it as part of the text, this time the FORTRAN equivalent:

.. code-block:: fortran

           subroutine f(x)
           real*8 x
           f = 42*x
           return
           end

Mathematics is written in plain LaTeX inside a begin-end tex environment:

.. math::
         f(x) = 42x.

Remember to use simple LaTeX: just the ``equation``, ``equation*``, ``\[ ... \]``,
``align``, ``align*``, ``alignat``, or ``alignat*`` environments!
Inline mathematics makes use of dollar signs: :math:`f(x)=42x`.

As LaTeX writer, remember that white space counts in DocOnce syntax!
Be extra careful with indentation of lists.

Also remember that DocOnce avoids backslash in label, ref and cite,
e.g., in references like [Ref1]_.
