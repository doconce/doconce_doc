__Summary.__
This report investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation $u'=-au$ with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.


======= Mathematical problem =======

We address the initial-value problem

!bt
\begin{align}
u'(t) &= -au(t), \quad t \in (0,T], label{ode}\\
u(0)  &= I,                         label{initial:value}
\end{align}
!et
where $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed parameters, and $u(t)$ is
the unknown function to be estimated. This mathematical model
is relevant for physical phenomena featuring exponential decay
in time.

======= Numerical solution method =======
label{numerical:problem}

We introduce a mesh in time with points $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$.
For simplicity, we assume constant spacing $\Delta t$ between the
mesh points: $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$, $n=1,\ldots,N$. Let
$u^n$ be the numerical approximation to the exact solution at $t_n$.

The $\theta$-rule is used to solve (ref{ode}) numerically:

!bt
\[
u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
\]
!et
for $n=0,1,\ldots,N-1$. This scheme corresponds to

  * The "Forward Euler":
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Euler_method"
    scheme when $\theta=0$
  * The "Backward Euler":
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_Euler_method"
    scheme when $\theta=1$
  * The "Crank-Nicolson":
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank-Nicolson"
    scheme when $\theta=1/2$
