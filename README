man: man page for doconce

src: source tree for doconce documentation and examples

pub: contains compiled documents from the src tree to be
     accessible on the web
     (strictly speaking, pub could only be a dir in gh-pages,
     but we keep master and gh-pages in sync)

web: entry point for the web pages, with index.html and github
     style files (just github's generated files are here,
     all the doconce material is in pub)
