DocOnce documents could be filtered to "Pweave":
"https://mpastell.com/pweave/docs.html".

A first approach is a Python program with comments *written in DocOnce
syntax*. A command `doconce pweave myprog.py` could transform the
comment lines to Pweave.

Another approach is to take a DocOnce document an spit out Pweave code.
This is more difficult since a lot of DocOnce syntax, figures and
movies for example, does not have a Pweave/Python counterpart, but one
could just support `!bc runcod` type of blocks (`runcod`, `runpro`,
`runshell`) and make `.py` file.

A third (and best?) approach is to extend Pweave to output
DocOnce. See the `Pweave` command. It should be easy, see "code":
"https://github.com/mpastell/Pweave/blob/master/pweave/formatters.py",
it is basically to mimic class `PwebTexFormatter` and
`PubSphinxFormatter`. Fork the project.

For syntax of Pweave, see "files related
to a real Pweave example":
