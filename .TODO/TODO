* Nikola for publication of multi-format doconce documents
  (say for a course), with optional blog comments.
  URL: "http://getnikola.com/handbook.html".
  Allow for MathJax and pretty code in blog parts?
* Finish translation to XML

===== From Google Doc to Doconce =====

Export in html, interpret the html (fairly complicated) or use
pandoc to go to latex. Then one needs adjustments:

 * All notes in the Google Doc: `\textsuperscript{\hyperref[.+?]{{[}.{]}}}` must be removed.
 * Remove tildes.
 * One-liners are probably h3 headlines.

Maybe pandoc for going from html to markdown is a better option.
Going from docx, rtf, odt via pandoc did not work.

===== From Doconce to Google Doc =====

Go to html, upload the html file to Google Drive, and open with Google Doc.
LaTeX math and figures do not work.
