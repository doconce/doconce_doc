First heading: we're calculating a bit
======================================

.. index:: calculating


..

    Today's first training is :math:`0+0`. It does not give much training...




.. note::
   Actually, :math:`1 + 1 = 2`. This result can be used without proof.





.. admonition:: Question

   What is :math:`1 - 1`?





.. admonition:: Summary

   Addition and subtraction are inverse operations.




.. index:: admon demo


.. admonition:: Box with title

   Here comes English text...

Even more advanced mathematics
------------------------------

We look at the world's most famous equation.


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so since the admon needs a title
   (the box formatting is therefore just ignored)


.. math::
         E = mc^2
