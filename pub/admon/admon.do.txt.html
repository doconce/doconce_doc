This note demonstrates how admonitions look like in the output format
_${FORMAT}_.

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">======= The four main types of admonitions =======</span>

% if OPTIONS != &quot;None&quot;:
Key options when compiling this document were

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bc</span>
${OPTIONS}
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!ec</span>
% endif

% if &#39;mdfbox&#39; in OPTIONS:
When using the default `mdfbox` style, there are some additional
customization that can be played around with. It is possible to
set the background color in the title and the color and thickness of
the frame. Typically, one can autoedit the output `.tex` file:

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bc</span>
doconce replace &#39;linecolor=black,&#39; &#39;linecolor=darkblue,&#39; mydoc.tex
doconce subst &#39;frametitlebackgroundcolor=.*?,&#39; \
        &#39;frametitlebackgroundcolor=blue!5,&#39; mydoc.tex
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!ec</span>
Actually, this specific edit is automatically done by DocOnce by choosing
the option `--latex_admon_color=bluestyle`.
% endif

Here is the warning admon:

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bwarning</span> Division by zero is illegal!
Most math systems will give fatal errors if you divide by zero.

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bc</span> sys
Terminal&gt; python -c &#39;print 4/0&#39;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!ec</span>
You should therefore be very careful with all expressions that may result
in division by zero. In Python, you can use a `try-except` clause to
test if some expression gives a `ZeroDivisionError` exception and take
appropriate actions. One example of a numerical method where division
by zero can cause problems is Newton&#39;s methods of finding solutions to
algebraic equations $f(x)=0$. In that algorithm, there is a division
by $f&#39;(x)$.
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!ewarning</span>

Question admon (without title).

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bquestion</span>
What are the admon options for `doconce format html`?

<span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic">#Answer: `--html_admon=`, `--html_admon_shadow`, `--html_admon_bg_color=`,</span>
<span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic"># `--html_admon_bd_color`. There is also `--html_box_shadow` for boxes.</span>
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!equestion</span>

Summary admon:

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bsummary</span>
The most popular methods for solving algebraic equations

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bt</span>
\[ f(x) = 0 \]
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!et</span>
are

 * Newton&#39;s method
 * The Bisection method
 * The Secant method
 * The Fixed-Point method ($f(x) = x - g(x)$)

Of these, Newton&#39;s method is fastest, the Bisection method is the most
reliable, the Secant method is a simplified Newton method, and the
Fixed-Point method is obviously very problem dependent in its behavior
since the user has the define the $g$ function.
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!esummary</span>

% if &#39;graybox2&#39; in OPTIONS:
The `graybox2` style has a special summary box that is embedded in the
text (aimed at proposals or popular articles to summarize main points;
the summary box is small 50% if A4 format, otherwise it is 80% of the width).
% endif

Here is a *notice admon*:

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bnotice</span> Tip: follow well-established conventions for variable names!
For example, in Python, variable and function names use
lower case letters separated by underscore, as in
<span style="color: #BA2121">`vibration_with_damping`</span> (while Java typically would
have `vibrationWithDamping`). Class names apply cap words,
as in `ProblemClass`.
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!enotice</span>

The four main admons are warning, notice, question, and summary, but you
may introduce other boxes by utilizing the title, as explained below.

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bnotice</span> The title of the box is fully customizable
This means that if you want
different types of boxes, e.g. a *detour* box and a *tip* box, you can just
open introduce the convention that detour applies the summary box and
starts with &#39;Detour:&#39; in the title, while the notice box is used for
tip boxes and as a title starting with &#39;Tip:&#39;.
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!enotice</span>

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">======= The block, quote and plain box environment =======</span>

DocOnce features a `block` environment with or without title.

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bblock</span>
Blocks are often used in slides to frame a collection of things.
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!eblock</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bblock</span> Block with title
Blocks can contain text, math, code, figures, movies.
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!eblock</span>

Here is a quote environment (`quote`):

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!bquote</span>
Sayre&#39;s law states that
&quot;in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake.&quot; &lt;linebreak&gt;
By way of corollary, it adds: &lt;linebreak&gt;
<span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;That is why academic politics are so bitter.&quot;</span> &lt;linebreak&gt;
*Source*: &quot;wikipedia&quot;: &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre&#39;s_law&quot;
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">!equote</span>

Boxes are very simple frames (without any icons, background color,
or stash, except for a shadow)
used for important results like
% if FORMAT == &quot;sphinx&quot;:
(note: box frame is not available in format _${FORMAT}_)
