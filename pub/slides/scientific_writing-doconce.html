<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>## How to run this demo:
## Use Firefox or Chrome
## Use beige or white or darkgrey reveal, maybe darkgrey if light is ok
## deck changes the font too often, according to text volume
## Have also a Beamer version ready (always - HTML5 slides are fragile)
##   and a big plain HTML file
##
## YouTube, Online Python Tutor, Sage Cell do not work:
##   - show YouTube in plain HTML or use Chrome (works with reveal and deck)
##   - show Online Python Tutor in Chrome with light background or in
##     Firefox with deck
##   - show Sage Cell in Sphinx version
## Show the doc/src/pyopt*/demo separately, it is better for
## tutor and sage cells

======= Pros and cons of various tools =======

!split
===== Popular tools anno 2014 and their math support =====

!bpop
 * _LaTeX_: de facto standard for math-instensive documents
 * _pdfLaTeX_, _XeLaTeX_, _LuaLaTeX_: takes over (figures in png, pdf) - use these!
 * _MS Word_: too clicky math support and ugly fonts, but much used
 * _HTML with MathJax_: &quot;full&quot; LaTeX *math*, but much tagging
 * _Sphinx_:
   somewhat limited LaTeX math support, but great support for web design,
   and less tagged than HTML
 * _reStructuredText_: similar to Sphinx, but no math support, transforms to
   lots of formats (LaTeX, HTML, XML, Word, OpenOffice, ...)
 * _Markdown_: somewhat limited LaTeX math support, but minor tagging,
   transforms to lots of formats (LaTeX, HTML, XML, Word, OpenOffice, ...)
 * _IPython notebooks_: Markdown code/math,
   combines Python code, interactivity, and
   visualization, but requires all code snippets to sync together
 * _Confluence_: Markdown-like input, with limited LaTeX math support, but converted to XML
 * _MediaWiki_: quite good LaTeX math support (cf. Wikipedia/Wikibooks)
 * Other _wiki_ formats: no math support, great for collaborative editing
 * _Wordpress_: supports full HTML with LaTeX *formulas* only
 * _Google blogger_: supports full HTML with MathJax
!epop

!split

===== LaTeX is very rich; other tools support much less =====

 * LaTeX has lots of fancy layouts, but few translates to other formats
 * LaTeX *inline* math: works with all math-enabled formats (LaTeX, MathJax, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki, Confluence, ...)
 * LaTeX *equation* math:
    * _LaTeX_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align` +
      `eqnarray`, `split`, `alignat`, ... (numerous!)
    * _MathJax_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _MediaWiki_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _Sphinx_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`
    * _Markdown_: `equation*`, `equation`, `eqnarray*`, `align*` (but no labels)

!split
===== LaTeX is very rich; other tools support much less =====

!bpop

 * Movies: raw HTML or YouTube/Vimeo, (LaTeX)
 * Subfigures: LaTeX (`subfigure`)
 * Floating computer code: LaTeX; fixed computer code: all
 * Floating tables: LaTeX; fixed tables: all
 * Algorithms: LaTeX

Highly non-trivial to translate from/to LaTeX!

!split
===== My colleagues face fundamental problem with going from LaTeX to IPython notebook (=Markdown) =====

!bblock Plan
I am used to write LaTeX paper/book-style with lots of
cross-references and *floating* figures, code snippets,
tables, algorithms, but now I *want to convert to
IPython notebooks*.
!eblock

!bblock Problem
Must have fixed figures, code snippets, tables. No algorithm environment,
cross-referencing, equation referencing. All code needed for a snippet
to run must be included. *It&#39;s a different writing style, but lots
of new opportunities*.
!eblock

!split
===== Examples on typesetting concerns (1) =====

!bpop
 * Sphinx refers to figures by the caption (has to be short!) and
   strips away any math notation (avoid that!).
 * Sphinx refers to sections by the title, but removes math in the
   reference, so avoid math in headlines.
 * Tables cannot be referred to by numbers and have to appear at
   fixed positions in the text.
 * Computer code has to appear at fixed positions in the text.
 * Algorithms must be written up using basic elements like lists or
   paragraphs with headings.
 * Recipes are often typeset as enumerated lists. For recipes with
   code or math blocks: drop the list (gives problems in some formats)
   and use paragraph (or subsubsection) headings with &quot;Step 1.&quot;,
   &quot;Step 2.&quot;, etc.
!epop

!split
===== Examples on typesetting concerns (2) =====

!bpop
 * Footnotes must appear as part of the running text (e.g., sentences
   surrounded by parenthesis), since only a few formats support footnotes.
 * Sphinx does not handle code blocks where the first line is indented.
 * Multiple plots in the same figure: mount the plots to one image
   file and include this (`montage` for png, gif, jpeg; `pdftk`, `pdfnup`,
   and `pdfcrop` for PDF).
 * If you need several equations *numbered* in an `align` environment,
   recall that Sphinx, Markdown, and MediaWiki cannot handle this,
   although they have LaTeX math support.
 * Markdown tolerates labels in equations but cannot refer to them.
!epop

# Not valid anymore:
# Keys for items in the bibliography are made visible by Sphinx so
#   &quot;bibitems&quot; a la BibTeX must look sensible and consistent.

!split
===== Examples on typesetting concerns (3) =====

!bpop
 * Index words can appear anywhere in LaTeX, but should be outside
   paragraphs in other tools.
 * References to tables, program code and algorithms can only be
   made in LaTeX.
 * Figures are floating in LaTeX, but fixed in other tools, so place
   figures exactly where they are needed the first time.
 * Curve plots with color lines do not work well in black-and-white
   printing. Make sure plots makes sense in color and BW (e.g., by
   using colors *and* markers).
!epop

!split
===== Solution I: Use a format that translates to many =====

 * Sphinx can do nice HTML, LaTeX, epub, (almost) plain text,
   man pages, Gnome devhelp files, Qt help files, texinfo, JSON
 * Markdown can do LaTeX, HTML, MS Word, OpenOffice, XML,
   reStructuredText, epub, DocBook, ... but not Sphinx
 * IPython notebook: can do LaTeX, reStructuredText, HTML, PDF,
   Python script
 * Sphinx and Markdown has some limited math support

!split
===== Solution II: Use DocOnce =====

&quot;DocOnce&quot;: &quot;http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/web/index.html&quot;
offers minimalistic typing, great flexibility wrt format,
especially for scientific writing with *much math and code*.

 * Can generate LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki, Google wiki,
   Creole wiki, reST, plain text
 * Made for large science books *and* small notes
 * Targets paper and screen
 * Many special features (code snippets from files, embedded movies,
   admonitions, modern LaTeX layouts, extended math support for Sphinx/Markdown, ...)
 * Very effective for generating slides from ordinary text
 * Applies Mako: DocOnce text is a program (!)
 * Much like Markdown, less tagged than LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx

===== Copying code from source files =====

We recommend to copy as much code as possible directly from the
source files:

!bc
@@@CODE path/to/file
@@@CODE path/to/file   fromto: start-regex@end-regex
!ec
For example, copying a code snippet starting with `def solver(` and
ending with (line not included) `def next(x, y,` is specified by
start and end regular expressions:

!bc
@@@CODE src/somefile.py  fromto: def solver\(@def next\(x,\s*y,
!ec

!split
===== Typesetting of code is implied by the file extension =====

 * `.py`: `pypro` if complete file, `pycod` if snippet
 * `.pyopt`: visualized execution via the &quot;Online Python Tutor&quot;: &quot;http://pythontutor.com&quot;
 * `.f`, `.f90`, `f.95`: `fpro` and `fcod`
 * `.cpp`, `.cxx`: `cpppro` and `cppcod`
 * `.c`: `cpro` and `ccod`
 * `.*sh`: `shpro` and `shcod`
 * `.m`: `mpro` and `mcod`
 * `ptex2tex`: between 40+ code styles in LaTeX
 * `pygments` is used for code in HTML (ca 10 styles)

!split
===== Demonstrating code execution; Online Python Tutor =====
label{slide:opt}

!split
===== Demonstrating code execution; Sage Cell Server =====
label{slide:sage:cell}

With `!bc pyscpro` or a file `*.pysc`, the code is typeset in
a sage cell:

!bc pyscpro
a = 2
b = 3
print &#39;a+b:&#39;, a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)

Equation (ref{mysec:eq:Dudt}) is important, see
cite{Larsen_et_al_2002,Johnson_Friedman_2010a}.
Also, cite{Miller_2000} supports such a view.

Figure ref{mysec:fig:myfig} displays the features.

===== Exercises =====

DocOnce offers a special format for *exercises*, *problems*, *projects*,
and *examples*:

!bc
===== Problem: Flip a Coin =====
label{demo:ex:1}
files=flip_coin.py, flip_coin.pdf
solutions=mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py
keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation

|bsubex
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.

|bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r &lt;= 0.5`.
|ehint
|esubex

|bsubex
Compute the probability of getting heads.

===== Rendering of the previous page =====

## Drop label{demo:ex:1} because it is being edited from \label to label
## in the editfix function in make.sh such that the verbatim label
## looks correct (latex.py replaces all label{} by \label{})

===== Problem: Flip a Coin =====

===== Exercises =====

All *exercises*, *problems*, and *projects* in a document are parsed
and available in a data structure (list of dicts) for further
processing (e.g., making a book of problems).

!bc

===== Use of preprocessors =====

 * Simple if-else tests a la the C/C++ preprocessor
 * `FORMAT` variable can be used to test on format, e.g.,
    * if latex/pdflatex do one sort of code (raw LaTeX)
    * if html, do another type of code (raw HTML)
 * Easy to comment out large portions of text
 * Easy to make different versions of the document
 * The mako preprocessor is really powerful - gives a
   complete programming language inside the document!


!split
===== DocOnce admonitions =====

!bwarning Use with caution!
Such environments may light up the document, but can be disturbing too.
Some admon styles have icons.
!ewarning

!bnotice Going deeper.
More details can be separated from the rest.
!enotice

!bquestion Time for review!
Tasks:

  * Maybe ask a question?
  * Or two?
!equestion

!bblock
Conclusion:

  * A special &quot;block&quot; admonition has less pronounced typesetting and
    can be used when no special icon is desired. Good for slides.
!eblock

!split
===== Generalized references =====

 * Chapters can be stand-alone documents or parts of a book
 * In a book you frequently refer to other chapters
 * When a chapter is a stand-alone document, it must refer to
   another stand-alone chapter document
 * This requires *generalized cross-referencing*
 * LaTeX has a solution: `xr`
 * DocOnce has a solution also for HTML, Sphinx, Markdown, ...

!split
===== Slides =====

Very effective way to generate slides from running text:

 * Take a copy of your DocOnce prose
 * Strip off as much text as possible
 * Emphasize key points in bullet items
 * Focus on key equations, figures, movies, key code snippets
 * Insert `!split` wherever you want a new slide to begin
 * Insert `!bpop` and `!epop` around elements to pop up
   in sequence (or insert `|\pause|` inside code blocks)
 * Use 7 `=` or 5 `=` in headings (H2 or H3)
 * Supported slide types: Beamer, HTML,
   HTML5 (reveal.js, deck.js, csss, dzslides)

!split
===== Example on slide code =====

!bc
!split
===== Headline =====

 * Key point 1
 * Key point 2
 * Key point 3: Although long
   bullet points are not recommended in general, we need
   it here for demonstration purposes to investigate
   what happens with the slide layout where there is
   so much text under one point

FIGURE: [fig/teacher1, width=100 frac=0.4]

Key equation:

|bt
\[ -\nabla^2 u = f \quad\hbox{in }\Omega \]

===== Classic slide types =====

 * LaTeX Beamer
 * Plain HTML w/various styles
   * separate slides w/navigation
   * one big slide

!split
===== HTML5 slide types =====

!bpop
 * Supported HTML5 packages:
   * &quot;reveal.js&quot;: &quot;http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/&quot;
   * &quot;deck.js&quot;: &quot;http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/&quot;
   * &quot;dzslides&quot;: &quot;http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/&quot;
   * &quot;csss&quot;: &quot;http://leaverou.github.com/csss/#intro&quot;
 * _Problem_: each package has its own syntax (though similar)
   * _Solution_: slide code is autogenerated from DocOnce
 * _Problem_: reveal and deck have numerous styles
   * _Solution_: easy &quot;to autogenerate all styles&quot;: &quot;http://doconce.github.com/teamods/doconce/demo/index.html&quot; for a talk
 * _Problem_: HTML5 slides need many style files
   * _Solution_: autocopy all files to talk directory
 * _Problem_: original versions of the styles have too large fonts,
   centering, and other features not so suitable for lectures
   with much math and code
   * _Solution_: DocOnce contains adjusted css files

===== DocOnce to HTML =====

Run in terminal window:
!bc
doconce format html doconcefile

# Solarized HTML style
doconce format html doconcefile --html_solarized

# Control pygments typesetting of code
doconce format html doconcefile --pygments_html_style=native

# Or use plain &lt;pre&gt; tag for code
doconce format html doconcefile --no_pygments_html

# Further making of slides

!split
===== Output for blog posts =====

Two formats of blog posts are supported:

 * Google&#39;s &quot;blogspot.com&quot;: &quot;http://doconce-report-demo.blogspot.no/&quot;:
   just paste the raw HTML (full support of math and code)
 * &quot;Wordpress&quot;: &quot;http://doconcereportdemo.wordpress.com/&quot;:
   despite limited math, DocOnce manipulates the math
   such that even `equation` and `align` work in Wordpress :-)

For wordpress, add `--wordpress`:
!bc
doconce format html doconcefile --wordpress
!ec
and paste the code into the text area.



!split
===== DocOnce to pdfLaTeX =====

!bc
doconce format pdflatex doconcefile --latex_code_style=lst

pdflatex doconcefile
bibtex doconcefile
pdflatex doconcefile
!ec

!split
===== DocOnce to Sphinx =====

!bc
doconce format sphinx doconcefile

# Autocreate sphinx directory
doconce sphinx_dir theme=pyramid doconcefile

# Copy files and build HTML document
python automake-sphinx.py

google-chrome sphinx-rootdir/_build/html/index.html

===== Installation =====

 * Source at &quot;GitHub&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/doconce/doconce&quot; (recommended!)
   * `git clone` + `python setyp.py install`
 * Many &quot;dependencies...&quot;: &quot;http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#installation-of-doconce-and-its-dependencies&quot;
   * Must have `preprocess` and `mako`
   * Need `latex`, `sphinx`, `pandoc`, etc. (see the &quot;Installation&quot;: &quot;http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#installation-of-doconce-and-its-dependencies&quot; description)
   * Easy for slides: only `preprocess` and `mako` are needed :-)

!split
===== Writing tips for LaTeX writers who want to convert to DocOnce *and generate other formats* =====

 * `doconce latex2doconce` helps the translation
 * Use `\[ \]`, `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, `align*` and nothing more for
   equations
 * Figures: avoid subfigures (combine image files instead), use `\includegraphics`, have captions after graphics, use short figure captions, position exactly where needed
 * Tables: have them inline (not floating), with no caption
 * Computer codes: have them inline (not floating)
 * Rewrite all `pageref` commands
 * Do not use *algorithm* environments, use simple list formatting instead
 * Avoid math in section headings
 * Use `pdflatex` or `xetex`
 * Use BibTeX (can easily be converted to &quot;publish&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/doconce/publish&quot; used by DocOnce)
 * Use `\href` for links (and insert links frequently)
 * Use the `bm` package for boldface $\bm{u}$
 * Place all newcommands in a separate file, with one definition per line
   (multiline definitions goes to a separate LaTeX preamble file in DocOnce)
 * Avoid all fancy LaTeX constructs - more backslashes than needed in math
   and sections is a bad thing...

!split
===== DocOnce writing tips =====

# * See the previous *Typesetting concerns I, II and III* slides for issues when writing
#   for multiple formats. However: DocOnce makes a fix so that Sphinx and
#   other formats works with labels in align environments :-)

Figures and movies:

 * Prepare figures in the right format: EPS for `latex`, PDF for `pdflatex`,
   PNG, GIF or JPEG for HTML formats (`html`, and HTML output from
   `sphinx`, `rst`, `pandoc`). One can omit the figure file extension and
   `doconce` will pick the most appropriate file for the given output format.
 * Let plotting programs produce both PDF/EPS and PNG files.
   (Recall that PDF and EPS are vector graphics formats that can scale to
   any size with much higher quality than PNG or other bitmap formats.)
 * Use `doconce combine_images` to combine several images into one.
 * Store all figures in a directory (tree) with name `fig` or `fig-X`,
   where `X` is some short logical name for the current document.
 * Store all movies in a directory (tree) with name `mov` or `mov-X`.
 * Favor the movie formats MP4, WebM, and Ogg (best suited for modern browsers).

!split
===== DocOnce writing tips =====

 * `\bm{u}` gives nicer boldface typesetting of math symbols than
   the alternatives `\boldsymbol{u}` and `\pmb{u}`.
 * For HTML-based formats using MathJax, `\bm{u}` is not supported
   and therefore automatically replaced by `\boldsymbol{u}` by DocOnce.
 * Use `\color{blue}{formula}` in math expressions to color a part.
 * Not all LaTeX math is supported by MathJax. Some legal LaTeX math
   might give MathJax problems - then one has to rewrite the expression
   to find a syntax that works both with LaTeX and MathJax.
 * Use `doconce spellcheck *.do.txt` to automatically spellcheck files.
 * Avoid page references and footnotes.

!split
===== Writing tips for sphinx and other formats =====

For output formats different from `latex`, `pdflatex`, and `html`:

 * Use labels only right after section headings and in equations.
 * Be careful with labels in `align` math environments: `pandoc`
   and `mwiki` cannot refer to them.
 * `sphinx` output requires
   * no math in section headings or figure captions
     (gets removed in references).
   * running text to start in column 1.
   * progressive section headings: after chapter (9 `=`) comes
     section (7 `=`), then subsection (5 `=`), then paragraph
     (3 `=`). Do not make jumps in this progression.
   * index entries (`idx{keyword}`) before the paragraph where they
     are introduced and place them *before* subsubsection
     headings (`=== ... ===`) and after subsection and section headings.
   * a line of text and no comment or math before code or list.
